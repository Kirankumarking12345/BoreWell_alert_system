# BoreWell_alert_system
an alert system that detects the persons near borewell

In India, there are many buildings that are under construction. For the purpose of water, 
they dig borewells and left open until the construction is completed In some places, 
borewells are left open because they cannot find groundwater. 
Nowadays there are many accident cases where children and animals were fallen into the borewells. 
So We proposed a system that can alert the people and monitor the borewell. We design the low-cost system using Arduino. 
The system monitors the borewell perimeter for the people using 2 ultrasonic sensors(HC-SR04).
If anyone crosses the borewell perimeter then buzzer alarms and alerts the people around.  
If in case anyone falls into the borewell then it intimates nearby people sending messages using GSM module.
We can mount the setup to that unused borewell and save lives. The main intention of this project is to avoid the borewell accidents.
